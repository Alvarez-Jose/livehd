### Open questions

We have a LUT node, but do we need it? We have a multiple input MUX but maybe even easier is to use the async memory.

LUT4('foo') == memory 1bit output, size 16 initialized to 'foo'

### HGLDD

 The json format used by Chisel/CIRCT to interface with tools like surfer.

 If LiveHD generates this, we can use to leverage verdi for things like Verilog and Pyrope
