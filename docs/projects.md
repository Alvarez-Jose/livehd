# Projects

This document has a list of potential projects for Live Hardware Development.
The document has a high level description and dependence chain for several
potential master thesis/project ideas. Contact Jose Renau if you want to work
on any of them to provide more details.

If you are an UCSC student, contact Professor Jose Renau
(https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau/) to coordinate, the idea is that you can do
a MS thesis/project or an undergraduate senior design project. It should take 2
full quarters. If there is enough progress and funds are available, it may be
possible to provide 1 quarter GSR in the last quarter for master students.

At the end of the document there is a list of finished projects as example, and
small tasks that are not enough for a thesis/project, but great to help.

[Small project list](docs/projects_small.md) has a list of small projects with different degree
of complexity, but they should require less than a quarter to implement. These
are better projects for starting students.


[Large project list](docs/projects_large.md) has a list of larger projects that are good
candidates for MS thesis. Those are more significant contributions that require
over one quarter to implement.


[Deprecated project list](docs/projects_deprecated.md) has a list of projects that were tried and/or
discarded but no longer trying to implement or already implemented.
