Things to test:
1. test clocked logic as well

Quick things to do:
1. Replace hier_test_diagram with a graphviz diagram that looks good

Things to do:
1. Create boundary curve
2. Create floorplans

Things to optimize:
1. area adjustment algorithm is naive, and inserts area when it isn't necessary
2. iterating over LGraphs could possibly use some work
3. preloading vectors with sizes known ahead of time could save some time
4. check to see if graph lib has fast functions to do what I'm doing myself

Refactors:
1. move recursive versions of functions into lambdas or just use static counters idk
2. replace '&' in lambdas with actual things used if # things used is small
3. seperate verbose output per-stage
