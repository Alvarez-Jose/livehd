Things to test:
1. test clocked logic as well

Things to do:
1. Discover regularity
2. Create boundary curve
3. Create floorplans

Things to optimize:
1. area adjustment algorithm is naive, and inserts area when it isn't necessary
2. iterating over LGraphs could possibly use some work
3. preloading vectors with sizes known ahead of time could save some time

Refactors:
1. move recursive versions of functions into lambdas - a lot cleaner!
