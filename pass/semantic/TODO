Extra tests that we can add:


ERRORS:

-If there is a write to a temporal variable (___x or anything with 3 _), there should be only one write in the whole program.


WARNINGS:

-There could be a "warning" (no error) for innefficient LNAST. E.g: if the is a temporal (___x) and used only in an assignment (foo = ___x). The "foo" could be directly in the LNAST node.

-If a variable is written and never read, you may want to issue a warning too (not if it is an output)

-If there is a output variable in the function declaration, it should be written. Warning otherwise


Features:

Modify Warning to add in line and position numbers for errors + warnings
