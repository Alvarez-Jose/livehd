No ___x, use tree pos

There are lots of ___x nodes to ref for tmps. It would be much better if an
"integer" is created for the temps. The integer can be a "tree_pos" of the
place that the temp gets assigned. THen, no need to have a map to find, or a
string/map to find the tree pos were the assignment happens.

This can reduce the size, speedup the process, reduce auxiliary tables
